Build a Highly Scalable Carousel Component in React JS.
Requirements:
  - We want to create a carousel component which takes array of images as input.
  - The component should efficiently handle a large number of images while maintaining scalability, performance optimizations, and extensibility.
  - Provide callback functions for events like image click, enabling users to define custom behavior.
  - Focus on Accessibility.
